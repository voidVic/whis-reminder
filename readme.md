# Whis Reminder

Whis (ウイス, Uisu) is the angelic attendant of Universe 7's God of Destruction, Beerus, as well as his martial arts teacher. He is a child of the Great Priest. Like all attendants, he is bound to the service of his deity and usually does not leave Beerus unaccompanied and also he can help you with maintaining your tasks and reminders.
